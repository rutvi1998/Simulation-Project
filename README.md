# ZENSE PROJECT

#### Pygame Physics Simulation

The project comprises of three, simple and interactive, physical simulations built using Python and Pygame. One can clone this repo 
onto his/her local system and run balls.py, discs.py or coalesce.py using the python interpreter to observe the simulations. One 
can interact with the first two simulations, using a mouse to select and throw around the items, the third simulation is
non-interactive.
